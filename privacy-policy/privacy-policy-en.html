        Thank you for using CrossSend. This application highly values user
        privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. We
        promise:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>No collection of personal identification information:</strong>
          CrossSend does not collect your name, email, phone number, or any
          other information that can identify you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No internet connection, no data uploads:</strong> All file
          transfers are completed between devices through local networks,

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local data remains completely on the device:</strong> Records,
          history, and cache generated within the application are only saved
          locally on your device. We neither access nor upload this data.
